# Next Steps:
Investigate how the rom is initiated, preumably the two player mode was not deactivated, and therefore can
be easily activated through a minor source code change.

I saved the screenshots each time I executed an action using the ALE Python interface. Specifically, I started with ale = ALEInterface() and then after each call to ale.act(action), I used rgb_image = ale.getScreenRGB(). Thus, the above image of 30 frames corresponds to all of the screenshots that I “saw” while playing in the span of a half-second
